# Python_assignment6
This assignment explores object-oriented programming and modular design principles through two real-world applications. The first task focuses on creating a university course catalog system by defining a base class Course with attributes course_code (e.g., "CS101"), course_name (e.g., "Introduction to Computer Science"), and credit_hours (e.g., 3). From this base class, two specialized subclasses are derived: CoreCourse, which adds a required_for_major property indicating whether the course is mandatory for a specific major, and ElectiveCourse, which introduces an elective_type property to classify electives, such as "general," "technical," or "liberal arts." The program utilizes inheritance and polymorphism, allowing objects of these subclasses to inherit and extend the functionality of the base class. The system enables the creation and display of both core and elective course details in a structured and interactive manner, demonstrating effective use of class hierarchies.

The second task involves developing a Python module named employee that encapsulates the properties and behaviors of an employee. The module defines a class Employee with two attributes, name and salary, alongside two methods, get_name() and get_salary(), for retrieving these attributes. By importing the employee module into the main program, an Employee object is created and its details are displayed. This task emphasizes modular programming by promoting code reusability and separation of concerns. Together, these tasks highlight key concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, modularity, and reusability, while addressing practical scenarios in course management and employee record-keeping.
